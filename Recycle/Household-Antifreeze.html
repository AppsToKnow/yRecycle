        <b><U>DEFINITION & USE</U></b>
            <BR>
            Antifreeze is a liquid used in the radiators of a motor vehicle.
            The main ingredients of antifreeze are ethylene glycol and water.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            <b><U>CREATE</U></b>
            <BR>
            Antifreeze is made by mixing water and ethylene glycol, so that it can lower the freezing point.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            <b><U>RECYCLE</U></b>
            <BR>
            Antifreeze can be recycled, however you can not place it in your curbside recycling bin. Place it in a sealable container and take it to your local autoparts store.
            <BR>
            <BR>
            Types of ways to recycle antifreeze are:
            <BR>
            <BR>
            Removing contaminants such as emulsified oils and heavy metals either by filtration, distillation, reverse osmosis, or ion exchange.
            <BR>
            <BR>
            Restoring critical antifreeze properties with additives. Additives typically contain chemicals that raise and stabilize pH, inhibit rust and corrosion, reduce water scaling, and slow the breakdown of ethylene glycol.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            <b><U>TRASH</U></b>
            <BR>
            Antifreeze is toxic to humans and animals. Waste antifreeze contains heavy metals such as lead, cadmium, and chromium.  Most states strictly regulate antifreeze disposal.
            <BR>
            <BR>
            NEVER dump antifreeze in the trash, or down your drain or sewer!
            <BR>
            <BR>
            Dumping antifreeze can cause serious water quality problems and might harm people, pets, or wildlife.
            <BR>
            <BR>
            State laws vary.  Please contact your local waste management facility.  Or you can place it in a sealable container and take it to your local autoparts store.
