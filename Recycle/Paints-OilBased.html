            <b><U>RECYCLE</U></b>
            <BR>
            Contact the Household Hazardous Waste facility in your area.  Many places will recycle oil based paints.

            </p>

            <b><U>TRASH</U></b>
            <BR>
            Always try to use up all the paint.  DO NOT dump paint down the sink. (In most states it is illegal to throw oil based paint away!)
            <BR>
            <BR>
            If you can’t use it on a project, paint it onto some cardboard and let it dry.  Make sure the paint is totally dry.
            <BR>
            <BR>
            Check the label to see if any hazardous material is in it.  Often times there is.  If this is the case you must contact the Household Hazardous Waste facility in your area.   If not, you can safely throw it away.
            </p>
