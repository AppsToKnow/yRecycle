        <b><U>DEFINITION & USE</U></b>
            <BR>
            Lithium Batteries are Batteries that have a lithium metal or lithium compound as a anode.  Lithium batteries are no different from regular batteries except they have a extremely long life,Depending on their design and chemical compound lithium battery cells can generate voltages that range from 1.5 to 3.7 volts.
            Items that use lithium batteries include: Replacement laptop batteries, most toys, Rc Things (Remote Control), TV Remotes, and other normal electrical appliances.

            <BR>
            The battery components are first made in to a slurry (a liquid version of the battery core) the the slurry is made into dried sheets then rolled around a electrode  and then sealed in an outer protective case

            <b><U>RECYCLE</U></b>
            <BR>
            Very Few Companies recycle lithium batteries as of now so it would be very hard to find a place that does so, even so the price for recycling lithium batteries is very high and as of now not much can be reused.

            <b><U>TRASH</U></b>
            <BR>
            You should only dispose of discharged batteries ( When it can no longer be used), A Normal lithium battery is considered discharged once it reaches 2 volts or less under a current of C/100 (C is the rated capacity of the battery in ampere-hours) . You can Throw it away just like any other battery, when they are in landfill they will decompose and their chemical innards will leak, although some Cities have their own guidelines
