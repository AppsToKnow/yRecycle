        <b><U>DEFINITION & USE</U></b>
            <BR>
            Pesticide is a mix of chemicals that is used to kill pests (bugs rats mice) it is often used on farms on fields and is often spread by plane (crop duster) or by tractors (lite-track) that carry gallons of pesticide. The word pesticide means mixture that kills pests. Pesticide is created to kill pests but it is dangerous enough that it can kill other animals and even humans.

            <b><U>CREATE</U></b>
            <BR>
            Pesticide is created by putting together an active ingredient (something that kills pests) and an inert ingredient. Once the ingredients are put together they are distilled. Now depending on the pesticide it is either mixed with kerosene (for liquid pesticides) or with dried ground-up vegetables (for powder or dust pesticide).

            <BR>
            There is a special way to throw away pesticide containers. First one has to use up all of the pesticide in the container. Step two throw away the pesticide container unless it says otherwise. Depending on your state the laws might be stricter than the federal laws regarding pesticide.
