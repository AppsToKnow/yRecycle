        <b><U>DEFINITION & USE</U></b>
            <BR>
            To use markers you pull off the cap and easily write on the board. Markers are made of a felt-tip flow, marker, or texta tip. They also have their own ink source with fibers such as porous, pressed fibers such as felt. People use them to pop the things they are drawing on.
            </p>

            <b><U>CREATE</U></b>
            <BR>
           A felt tip is placed on the end of a hollow cylinder with permanent ink inside. Another way is to take a cylinder and put a tip already put in dye. Then put more of the dye in the cylinder the  put the tip in the cylinder then put a polyester cylinder inside the marker barrel to make a reservoir. Then make sure the tip is at the bottom and the cap is on top.

            <p>
            <b><U>RECYCLE</U></b>
            <BR>
           The whole marker is recyclable but the tip and the reservoir must be removed first. The caps can be recycled at recycling facilities that accept #5 plastic. Crayola recently announced something called the color cycle which converts markers to energy. It is a process which repurposes the entire marker, no matter the kind of plastic or how they are made. You can learn more about this in the color cycle link in resources.

            <b><U>TRASH</U></b>
            <BR>
            No, there is not a special way to dispose this item. All you must do is throw them away in your curbside recycling bin. Markers do not have chemicals that can hurt the environment or humans.
