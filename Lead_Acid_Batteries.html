        <b><U>DEFINITION & USE</U></b>
            <BR>
            Definition: A secondary battery in which the electrodes are grids of lead immersed in in dilute sulfuric acid.  The difference between a primary battery and a secondary battery is that you can't reuse a primary battery but you can reuse a secondary battery.

Use: Cars, boats, and other public transportation vehicles use these batteries for energy.  In a power outage or a blackout lead acid batteries give energy to hospitals so the patients are safe.

            </p>

            <b><U>CREATE</U></b>
            <BR>
           Lead acid is melted, stirred and atomised then added with oxygen to create lead oxide and with lead oxide you can make lead acid.  It stores energy in chemical form in 62 cell vaults.  Cell vaults is where they store the lead acid.

            </p>
            
            <p>
            <b><U>RECYCLE</U></b>
            <BR>
           Most of the lead acid batteries can be recycled. When recycled it needs less energy than regular batteries but gives of the same amount energy and power. When you go buy your new battery give your old one to the retailer. So they can dispose of it properly.

            <b><U>TRASH</U></b>
            <BR>
            When you go buy your new one just give your old one to the retailer.  Lead is a toxic metal that can enter the body by inhalation of lead dust or ingestion when touching the mouth with lead-contaminated hands. If leaked onto the ground, the acid and lead particulates contaminate the soil and become airborne when dry.  If lead acid harms a child it can affect a child's growth,  cause brain damage,  harm kidneys,  and impair hearing.  If it harms an adult it can cause memory loss and lower the ability to concentrate,  it can also harm the reproductive system of both female and male.
