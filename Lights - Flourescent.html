            <BR>
            Fluorescent bulbs can be recycled because its illegal to throw them away.  But do not put them in your curbside recycle bin.

Fluorescent lighting should be recycled at the local hazardous waste facility. Several national hardware stores and home goods retailers offer free CFL recycling.

            <b><U>TRASH</U></b>
            <BR>
            Fluorescent lights should NOT be throw away because its a hazardous waste.  The mercury causes the fluorescent lights to be hazardous.

In a LANDFILL:
Mercury could get into our groundwater and when it does we canâ€™t drink it. The lamps with fluorescent bulbs have mercury in them ,if bulbs  break the mercury will be released into the groundwater.
Effects on the ENVIRONMENT :
Chemicals: methylmercury (a chemicals in an organism that  is  an environmental  toxicant) can damage your nervous system but usually happens in the womb when  the mother consumed it.
