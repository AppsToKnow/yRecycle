           Gasoline is a fuel made from petroleum. It is mostly made from crude oil (remains of plants and animals) from hundreds of millions of years ago. Most gasoline is used in cars and light trucks. You can also fuel boats, recreational vehicles, and landscaping equipment with gasoline.

            <BR>
            Since gasoline is so hazardous, you must be very careful with it. You canâ€™t just put it anywhere. In order to get rid of gasoline safely, you should check with your local government or hazardous waste disposal center to find out where is the best place to dispose of your gasoline. You could also just use the gasoline instead of wasting it.

Add details about the chemicals in gasoline: Gasoline has more than 150 chemicals in it. For example, benzene, toluene, and at times, lead. The most common form of gasoline used now is MTBE (methyl tertiary-butyl ether). It is colorless, flammable, and has a strong odor. The chemical formula is C5H12O.


Health Hazards- You usually come into contact with gasoline by breathing it, drinking or eating something that has been contaminated, or just touching it. Breathing a large amount of gasoline could cause you to have lung or nose irritation. It could also cause dizziness or a headache. If you were to swallow it, it would give you stomach irritation. Drinking it could result in death.
If gasoline were to get into the groundwater people could be exposed to it by either drinking it or breathing it. This could happen while cooking, bathing, showering, and drinking from a contaminated water source. Some of it can be absorbed through the skin.
