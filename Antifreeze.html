        <b><U>DEFINITION & USE</U></b>
            <BR>
            Antifreeze is a liquid used in the radiators of a motor vehicle.
The main ingredient of antifreeze is ethylene glycol and water.

            <b><U>CREATE</U></b>
            <BR>
            Antifreeze is made by mixing water and ethylene glycol, so that it can lower the freezing point.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            <b><U>RECYCLE</U></b>
            <BR>
           Antifreeze can be recycled, however you can not place it in your curbside recycling bin. Place it in a sealable container and take it to your local autoparts store.
 
Types of ways to recycle antifreeze are:
Removing contaminants such as emulsified oils and heavy metals either by filtration, distillation, reverse osmosis, or ion exchange.
Restoring critical antifreeze properties with additives. Additives typically contain chemicals that raise and stabilize pH, inhibit rust and corrosion, reduce water scaling, and slow the breakdown of ethylene glycol.

            <b><U>TRASH</U></b>
            <BR>
            Antifreeze is toxic to humans and animals. Waste antifreeze contains heavy metals such as lead, cadmium, and chromium.  Most states strictly regulate antifreeze disposal. 

NEVER dump antifreeze in the trash, or down your drain or sewer! 

Dumping antifreeze can cause serious water quality problems and might harm people, pets, or wildlife.

State laws vary.  Please contact your local waste management facility.  Or you can place it in a sealable container and take it to your local autoparts store.
