        <b><U>DEFINITION & USE</U></b>
            <BR>
            Alkaline batteries are batteries that work with the reaction between zinc and manganese dioxide. A rechargeable alkaline battery allows reuse of specially designed cells.
Alkaline batteries account for 80% of manufactured batteries in the US and over 10 B individual units produced worldwide. 
Alkaline batteries are in many household items such as MP3 players, CD players, digital cameras, pagers, toys, lights, and radios, to just name a few.

            while the Cathode(http://www.doitpoms.ac.uk/tlplib/batteries/figures/Alkaline_manganese_dioxide.png)   is on the battery's outside, it is actually produced first. The material used to make the cathode is primarily a mixture of manganese dioxide and an electrolyte called potassium hydroxide--as opposed to ammonium chloride or zinc chloride in other batteries--along with graphite. These materials ground up into granules, mixed together, aged and compacted into a circular hollow tablet. A single battery usually uses three of these tablets, which are inserted into a steel can. The can and tablets combine to make the cathode. Sealant is placed near the top of the can to prevent the battery from leaking.
Anode
To prevent the cathode and anode from touching one another, a small sheet of paper is rolled up and inserted inside the cathode. This paper is soaked in electrolyte to promote electrolyte conductivity when using the battery. The anode for alkaline batteries is a gel made up mostly of zinc powder. This gel is poured into the can within the paper that borders the inside of the cathode.

Sealing
While the battery is now functional, it must be sealed to preserve its shelf life. The primary seal is at the bottom of the can. This seal is made of a brass nail, plastic gasket, steel washer and metal cap. These parts are assembled to look like a nail with a very large head, which is then placed within and on the cap. The nail is inserted inside the anode and is used as the current collector while the assembled cap on top of it acts as the seal. The battery then has a metal top welded on the other end which has a tip to act as its positive terminal.)   is on the battery's outside, it is actually produced first.

            <b><U>RECYCLE</U></b>
            <BR>
           Single-use batteries contain materials that are both recyclable and considered Dangerous to the environment. You can drop them off at a household hazmat (HHW) facility or participate in the many mail-in or take-back programs that are available all over the country.

            <BR>
            The batteries no longer contain mercury, so they can now safely be disposed with regular waste.
