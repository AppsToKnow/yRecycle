            <BR>
            Yes, you must empty out the can completely or else the paint can leak out and sink into the ground and could pollute soil and prevent plants from growing.
            <BR>
            <BR>
            Empty spray paint cans can be placed in curbside recycling programs.
            <BR>
            <BR>
            If they still have paint in them DO NOT place them in recycling bins.  Instead contact your local recycling program.
