        <b><U>DEFINITION & USE</U></b>
            <BR>
           When your trying to get coffee fast you go to fast food places, they don't give you a ceramic coffee mug, usually they give you a paper cup made of foamy polystyrene.  Polystyrene is what most people call styrofoam. Styrofoam has a light weight and is about 95% air .

            <b><U>RECYCLE</U></b>
            <BR>
          No, you cannot recycle them because fast food coffee cups have plastic or wax lining which helps you but not the environment. Plastic or wax lining helps with temperature control, but it also makes them non-recyclable. Some communities accept paper cups ,but its usually to difficult separate during the process. Starbucks is trying to lead the way with their recyclable cups by 2015.

            <b><U>TRASH</U></b>
            <BR>
            In some communities they accept coffee cups for recycling but thereâ€™s a specialized process. Paper cups take up to 2-6 weeks to decompose. In America paper is the largest waste item 6.5 million trees are killed everyday, and thats only part of the problem. The trees can no longer produce oxygen or absorb carbon dioxide. The styrofoam in coffee cups harm the environment but it also affects us. When people warm up coffee cups toxic chemicals can seep right into what they are about to drink.  This can harm our health and reproductive system. In the environment polystyrene foam is dumped causing litter,which animals eventually will get to and eat. This material is broken down into little pieces that can clog their digestive system.
